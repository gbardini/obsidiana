A local high school student was asked to do some statistics work in Python. She's trying to calculate the average number of students at all of the local high schools.

## CHALLENGE

Debug the code so that it correctly prints the solution to the math problem.

Remember, `print()` just prints whatever is in quotes. If you want to evaluate a mathematical expression, you can't put it in quotes.

```python
print("(250 + 241 + 244 + 255) / 4")
```

## ANSWER

```python
print((250 + 241 + 244 + 255) / 4)
```

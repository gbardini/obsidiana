Code is just a series of instructions that computers can follow. Computers obey each instruction, _one after another_.

Programs can be comprised of _many_ instructions. Like many. Like millions.

Addition is one of the most common instructions in coding.
## PRINTING NUMBERS

`print()` can print text using quotes:

```python
print("some text here")
```

but it can also print numbers without quotes:

```python
print(1)
```

and you can do math directly inside the parentheses:

```python
print(1 + 2)
```

## ASSIGNMENT

It's common in videogames to do basic addition. For example, we may need to calculate the additional damage a sword deals when it is enchanted with a spell.

Our hero's sword does `250` normally but does an additional `75` damage when it's enchanted.

Calculate and print the result of `250 + 75`.

```python
print(250 + 75)
```

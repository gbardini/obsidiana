Thousands of students start their coding journey right here with Python. We think it's the best programming language to get started with. Python is famous for being a simple language that's easy to read and write.

However, just because it's simple that doesn't mean it's not useful! Python is an _extremely_ popular language in the industry, and is well-known for:

- Backend web servers
- DevOps and cloud engineering
- Machine learning
- Scripting and automation
- etc...

On the other hand, it's not particularly well-known for front-end work. While it's _possible_ to do so, Python isn't typically used to build visual user interfaces.

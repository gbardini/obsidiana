_Syntax_ in programming are the rules that define what properly structured expressions and statements look like in that language. For example, in Python, the following would be considered _correct_ syntax:

```python
print("hello world")
```

While in a different programming language, like Go, the correct syntax would be:

```python
fmt.Println("hello world")
```

Code can have many different problems that prevent it from working as intended. Some examples include:

- A bug in the logic. For example, a program that should add numbers together, but instead multiplies them.
- A problem with speed. A program that calculates how to play the perfect game of chess might never be able to finish because it requires too many calculations.
- A problem with syntax. This is the most common problem for new developers. Luckily the Python interpreter will try to give you a descriptive error message in the console to help you find the problem.

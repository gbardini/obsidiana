Code runs in order, starting at the top of the program. For example:
```python
print("this prints first")
print("this prints second")
print("this prints last")
```

Each `print()` instruction prints on a new line.

## ASSIGNMENT

The dialogue in our game needs to be printed in the correct order! In the first level, our hero encounters a talking owl named Jax. Let's display their conversation to the user through text.

Rearrange the code so that it prints in the following order.

```
Jax: B-Kaw!
Hero: ...
Jax: Where are you off to this morning? Bkaw...
Hero: Where did an owl learn to speak??
```

```python
print("Jax: B-Kaw!")
print("Hero: ...")
print("Jax: Where are you off to this morning? Bkaw...")
print("Hero: Where did an owl learn to speak??")
```

[Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) is jargon for "valid code that the computer can understand". For example, the following code is _invalid_ syntax:

```python
prnt("hello world")
```

`prnt()` is _not_ a valid function because "print" is spelled incorrectly. As a result, an error will be thrown and the code won't execute.

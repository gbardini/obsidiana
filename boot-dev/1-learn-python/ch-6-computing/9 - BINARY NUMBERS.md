[Binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) are just "base 2" numbers. They work the same way as "normal" base 10 numbers, but with 2 symbols instead of 10.

Each `1` in a binary number represents a greater multiple of 2. In a 4-digit number, that means you have the eight's place, the four's place, the two's place, and the one's place. Similar to how in decimal you would have the thousandth's place, the hundredth's place, the ten's place, and the one's place.

- `0001` = 1
- `0010` = 2
- `0011` = 3
- `0100` = 4
- `0101` = 5
- `0110` = 6
- `0111` = 7
- `1000` = 8

## BINARY IN PYTHON

You can write an integer in Python using binary syntax using the `0b` prefix

```python
print(0b0001)
# Prints 1

print(0b0101)
# Prints 5
```

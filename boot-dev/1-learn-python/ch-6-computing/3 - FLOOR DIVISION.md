Python has great out-of-the-box support for mathematical operations. This, among other reasons, is why it has had such success in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

Floor division is like normal division except the result is [floored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions) afterward, which means the remainder is _removed_. As you would expect, this means the result is an `integer` instead of a `float`.

```python
7 // 3
# 2 (an integer)
```

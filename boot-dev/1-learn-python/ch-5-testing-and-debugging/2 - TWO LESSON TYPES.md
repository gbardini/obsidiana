As we talked about, there are 2 types of coding lessons on Boot.dev:

1. Console output lessons
2. Unit-test lessons

## CONSOLE OUTPUT LESSONS

- Only 1 file of code, usually with a comment explaining where to write your code
- When you "submit" your code, its console output must match the expected output exactly to pass
- Debug `print` statements will cause your code to fail submission, so remove them before submitting

## UNIT-TEST LESSONS

- 2 files of code: `main` and `main_test`. You can read the tests but you can't edit them
- When you "submit" your code, the return values of your functions must match the expected values exactly to pass
- Console output is ignored, you can leave debug `print` statements in your code

## WHICH IS MORE COMMON?

Going forward you'll encounter far more unit-test lessons than console output lessons, but you'll still see both from time to time. Different concepts are better suited to different types of lessons.

Functions are tricky! I wouldn't say they're _hard_, but it does take a minute to get used to them. You might find yourself slowing down a bit in this chapter, and if you do, know that that's totally normal.

Let's break down this function line by line so you can understand every nook and cranny of it.

```python
def area_of_circle(r):
    pi = 3.14
    result = pi * r * r
    return result

radius = 5
area = area_of_circle(radius)
print(area)
# 78.5
```

Here's a chronological explanation of what happens when the above code is executed:

1. `def area_of_circle(r)`

The `area_of_circle` function is defined for later use, but _not_ called. It accepts a single input named `r`. The body of the function (`pi = 3.14`... etc) is ignored for now.

2. `radius = 5`

A new variable called `radius` is created and set to the value `5`.

3. `area_of_circle(radius)`

The `area_of_circle` function is called with `radius` (in this case 5) as the input. Finally, we jump back to the function definition.

4. `def area_of_circle(r):`

We will now start executing the body of the function, and `r` is set to `5`.

5. `pi = 3.14`

A new variable called `pi` is created with a value of `3.14`.

6. `result = 3.14 * r * r`

Some simple math is evaluated (`3.14 * 5 * 5`) and stored in the `result` variable.

7. `return result`

The result variable is returned from the function as output.

8. `area = area_of_circle(radius)`

The returned value is stored in a new variable called `area` (in this case `78.5`).

9. `print(area)`

The value of `area` is printed to the console.

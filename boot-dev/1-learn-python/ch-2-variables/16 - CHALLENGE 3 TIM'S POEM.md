Tim is working on a program that writes a poem to the console. However, Tim is having trouble getting the poem to print on only two lines.

## CHALLENGE

Use string concatenation to assign values to the `line_one` and `line_two` variables correctly.

`line_one` should include part 1 and 2  
`line_two` should include part 3 and 4

```python
part_one = "Roses are red, "
part_two = "violets are blue."
part_three = "Python is cool, "
part_four = "and so are you!"

# Don't touch above this line

line_one = part_one + part_two # ?
line_two = part_three + part_four # ?

# Don't touch below this line

print(line_one)
print(line_two)
```

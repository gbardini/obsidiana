Now that we know how to store and change the value of variables let's do some math!

Here are some examples of common mathematical operators in Python syntax.

```python
sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Create a new variable called `armored_health` on line 4 and set it equal to `player_health * armor_multiplier`

```python
player_health = 1000
armor_multiplier = 2

# create armored_health here
print(armored_health)
```

## ANSWER

```python
player_health = 1000
armor_multiplier = 2

armored_health = player_health *  armor_multiplier # create armored_health here
print(armored_health)
```

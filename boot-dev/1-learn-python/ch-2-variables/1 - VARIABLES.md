[Variables](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/variables.html) are how we store data in our program. So far we've been directly printing data by passing it directly into the `print()` function.

Now we are going to learn to save the data in variables so we can use and change it before we need to print it.

A variable is a name that we define that will point to some data. For example, I could define a new variable called `my_height` and set its value to 100. I could also define a variable called `my_name` and set it equal to "Lane".

## CREATING VARIABLES

To create a new variable in Python we use the following syntax:

```python
my_new_variable_two = 2
this_can_be_called_anything = 3
```

## ASSIGNMENT

We need to keep track of our hero's health!

On the first line of code, create a new variable named `player_health` and set it equal to `1000`.

```python
player_health = 1000
print(player_health)
```

Variable names can't have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

In Python you should use "snake_case" when creating variable names - it's become the "rule of thumb" for the language. By way of comparison, "camelCase" is where the beginning of each new word except the first is capitalized.

## CASING EXAMPLES

### NO CASING (PURE INSANITY)

```python
somevariablehere = 10
```
### CAMEL CASE

```python
someVariableHere = 10
```
### SNAKE CASE

```python
some_variable_here = 10
```

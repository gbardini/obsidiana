Creating negative numbers in Python works the way you probably expect, just add a minus sign in front of a number.

```python
my_negative_num = -1
```

## ASSIGNMENT

When our hero walks through poison, their health should be reduced. Right now the hero is _gaining_ `10` health instead of _losing_ `10` health. Change the `poison_damage` variable to be negative.

## FUN FACT

Computers can do math on _really_ big numbers very quickly.

```python
player_health = 100
poison_damage = 10

# don't touch below this line

player_poison_health = player_health + poison_damage

print(player_poison_health)

```

## ANSWER

```python
player_health = 100
poison_damage = 10

# don't touch below this line

player_poison_health = player_health - poison_damage

print(player_poison_health)

```

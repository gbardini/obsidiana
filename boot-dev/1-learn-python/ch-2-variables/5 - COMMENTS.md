Comments don't run like code, they are _ignored_ by the computer. Comments are useful for adding reminders or explaining what a piece of code does in plain English.
## SINGLE LINE COMMENT

```python
# speed is a variable describing how fast your player moves
speed = 2
```

## MULTI-LINE COMMENTS (AKA DOCSTRINGS)

You can use triple quotes to start and end multi-line comments as well:

```python
"""
    the code found below 
    will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
"""
print('Hello, World!')
```

This is useful if you don't want to add the `#` to the start of each line when writing paragraphs of comments.

## ASSIGNMENT

Line #1 in the code was meant to be a comment, but the developer forgot to use the right syntax (`#`). Fix the bug by commenting out the first line of code.

```python
the best_sword variable holds the value of the best sword in the game
best_sword = "scimitar"
print(best_sword)
```

## ANSWER

```python
# the best_sword variable holds the value of the best sword in the game
best_sword = "scimitar"
print(best_sword)
```
